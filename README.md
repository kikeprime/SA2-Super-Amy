SA2 Super Form Overload

GameBanana page: https://gamebanana.com/mods/481880

This repository contains the source code for the mod's sa2-super-amy.dll file.

Before building set the submodules' SDK and Platform Toolset versions to that version(s) that you installed and set the build type Release x86.

If you edit mod.cpp you can enable Super/Hyper Mechless Tails and Super Knuckles too by uncommenting their init function calls.

Enjoy!
