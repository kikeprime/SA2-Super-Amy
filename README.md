This repository contains the source code for the mod's sa2-super-amy.dll file.

Before building set the submodules' SDK and Platform Toolset versions to that version(s) that you installed and set the build type Release x86.

In this repository Super/Hyper Mechless Tails and Super Knuckles are also enabled.

Enjoy!
